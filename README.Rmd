## Presentation

The goal of the Data Analysis Module in the Summer Semester is to provide **hands-on experience** in data analysis of large scale datasets and get first insights into using computational tools to provide a reproducible data analysis.

After this module, you will have

* gained skills in programming language such as R or Python (depending on the chosen project)
* learn to use tools to perform reproducible analysis, like Markdown/Notebooks and GitHub
* understand the key steps in a large-scale data analysis

----------

## News

We will provide news and deadlines under this section.

## Projects

We have defined **4 projects** in data analysis; each project will comprise **5 different sub-projects**. Most of the time, these 5 sub-projects are very similar to each other but analyze slightly different datasets.

You can find a description of the 5 projects here:

1. [Hallmarks of cancer and cancer metabolism](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/01_Cancer-Hallmarks_2020)
2. [Biomedical image analysis](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/02_Image-Analysis_2020)
3. [Analysis of Cancer transcriptome](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/03_Cancer-Transcriptome_2020)
4. [Aberrant expression in metastatic lung cancer](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/04_Lung-Cancer_2020)

You will find a description of the projects an a list of supervisors/tutors in these description files.

**Important information**:

* Projects 1,3,4 are data analysis topics/projects which will be conducted in R
* Projects 2 is rather a *programming project*, which requires some more advanced programming skills, and will be done in Python.

### Slides

You can find the slides of the presentations made on Wednesday, 17th April here:

* [General presentation - update 24/04/2019 (C. Herrmann)](./doc/Presentation.pdf)
* [Presentation Project 03 (C. Ritter)](./doc/Project_03.pdf)
* [Presentation Project 02 (J. Perales)](./doc/Project_02.pdf)

### Documentation

These are the Python Notebook files with Python intro provided by David Schwarzenbacher

* [Python notebooks (D. Schwarzenbacher)](./doc/Python_Intro.zip)

## Rules

### How do I select my project/team?

* each sub-project will be worked out by groups of **4 students**. 
* the choice of sub-project and definition of the teams should be completed by **XXXX** (no extension!)
* once the choice has been made, register your team in the Google Sheet (URL provided during the first presentation)

### Who will help me?

For each project, there will be a **master tutor** assigned to this project. Each team within a project will have **a weekly online meeting** with his tutor on **Wednesday between 10am and 1 pm** during 20-30 minutes.


### What am I supposed to do?

1. select your project and you teammates and register **before XXXXXl**
2. **Project presentation on XXXXX**: prepare a 10 minutes presentation (+10 minutes discussion/questions) based on the indicated literature for each project, listing the relevant questions/topics that you want to adress in your project. During this presentation, you should also explain the datasets you will be working with, and how you want to make use of them. 
3. **Final presentation XXXX** (15 minutes + 10 minutes discussion / questions) 

### How will I be evaluated?

Each student will have an individual evaluation! This will take into account the *2 presentations* listed above, as well as the report (markdown report / jupyter notebook depending on the projects).

During the oral presentations, each student will be asked to explain part of the analysis, especially to explain the code! So everyone should make sure to be involved in the project.

Reports will be submitted (or "committed") to the Github repository of the group as a `.Rmd` or `.ipynb` file.

**Important note**: *Science is collaboration!* so please make sure to share your insights/knowledge with other groups! You are free to choose whatever way to do so, e.g. Whatsapp groups or [Slack groups](https://slack.com/intl/de-de/).

## Practical aspects

Depending on the projects, you will use either R (Topics 01/03/04) or python (Topics 02). 

### R-based projects

You will use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), and create a [R markdown document](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). These will consist in a mixture of plain text (explanations about the analysis, comments,...) and code pieces (called `chunks`). The advantage is that the report will be automatically generated (either as pdf or html document) when compiling the markdown file. All plots will be automatically and dynamically created from the code pieces in the markdown document.

### Python based projects

Similar to R markdow documents, the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) offers a way to mix markdown text together with Python code. Installing Jupyter Notebook requires the installation of Python. Just follow the instructions on the previous link.


### GitHub

Git is a system to handle collaborative projects, in which each member of the team is contributing to the project. You can check [this website](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) for a simple intro to Git/GitHub.

Git can be used either from the command line, or using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a GUI manager which makes commiting changes, etc... very easy.

This tool will help you (and us...) track the progress of your project.
