## Presentation

The goal of the Data Analysis Module in the Summer Semester is to provide hands-on experience in data analysis of large scale datasets and get first insights into using computational tools to provide a reproducible data analysis.

After this module, you will have

* gained skills in programming language such as R or Python (depending on the chosen project)
* learn to use tools to perform reproducible analysis, like Markdown/Notebooks and GitHub

## Topics

We have defined **5 topics** in data analysis; each topic will comprise **5 different projects**. Most of the times, these 5 projects are very similar to each other but analyze slightly different datasets.

You can find a description of the 5 projects here:

1. [Genetic interactions in cancer](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/01-genetic-interactions-in-cancer)
2. [Cellular response to drug perturbations](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/02-cellular-response-to-drug-pertubations)
3. [Biomedical image analysis](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/03-biomedical-image-analysis)
4. [single-cell expression analysis](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/04-single-cell-analysis-of-blood)
5. [Cancer genomics](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/05-cancer-genomics)

You will find a description of the projects an a list of supervisors/tutors in these description files.
