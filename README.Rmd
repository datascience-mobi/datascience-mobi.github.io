## Presentation

The goal of the Data Analysis Module in the Summer Semester is to provide hands-on experience in data analysis of large scale datasets and get first insights into using computational tools to provide a reproducible data analysis.

After this module, you will have

* gained skills in programming language such as R or Python (depending on the chosen project)
* learn to use tools to perform reproducible analysis, like Markdown/Notebooks and GitHub

## Topics

We have defined **5 topics** in data analysis; each topic will comprise **5 different projects**. Most of the times, these 5 projects are very similar to each other but analyze slightly different datasets.

You can find a description of the 5 projects here:

1. [Genetic interactions in cancer](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/01-genetic-interactions-in-cancer)
2. [Cellular response to drug perturbations](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/02-cellular-response-to-drug-pertubations)
3. [Biomedical image analysis](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/03-biomedical-image-analysis)
4. [single-cell expression analysis](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/04-single-cell-analysis-of-blood)
5. [Cancer genomics](https://github.com/datascience-mobi/05-cancer-genomics)

You will find a description of the projects an a list of supervisors/tutors in these description files.

## Rules

### How do I select my project/team?

* each project will be worked out by groups of **4 students**. 
* the choice of project and definition of the teams should be completed by **Wednesday, 24th April** (no extension!)
* once the choice has been made, register your team in the Google Sheet (URL provided during the first presentation)

### Who will help me?

For each topic, there will be a **master tutor** assigned to this topic. Each team will have **weekly meetings** with his tutor on **Wednesday between 10am and 1 pm** during 20-30 minutes.

Meeting places will be:

* BioQuant Seminar room SR042 / SR044
* BioQuant meeting lounges (ground floor, red sofas)
* IPMB meeting room 5th floor (behind the CIP room)

### What am I supposed to do?

1. select your project and you teammates (see point above)
2. prepare a 10 minutes presentation based on the indicated literature for each project, listing the relevant questions/topics that you want to adress in your project. During this presentation, you should also explain the datasets you will be working with, and how you want to make use of them. The presentation will be on **Wednesday, 15th May** in from of the supervors.
